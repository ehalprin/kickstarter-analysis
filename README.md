# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project was initiated by Louise, who is looking to fund her play, Fever. She believes she will need to raise $10,000, and would like to set herself up for success in crowdfunding by first analyzing data on other crowdfunding projects from Kickstarter.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze crowdfunding data to identify what factors increase the likelihood of a particular project being successful. In this case, I am looking to determine what makes a crowdfunding project for a play successful. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To analyze if launch date had any correlation with the success of a crowdfunding project, I first used a formula to convert the Unix timestamps in the "deadline" and "launched_at" columns into readable dates. I then was able to create a pivot table that showed how many successful, failed, and caled projects happened in each month of the year, filtered by theater projects specifically. The results of the analysis can be viewed here: ![Outcomes_vs_Goals.png.png](ehalprin/kickstarter-analysis/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png.png)

Overall, the number of canceled and failed projects were more or less consistent across time. The number of successful projects, however, spiked in the months of May and June, remaining elevated in July and August until returning to normal levels for the fall and dipping in the winter.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
